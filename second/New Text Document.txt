equation of striaght line
1.
=> y = mx +c
	m = gradient
	c = the cut part of the y-axis
=> y = mx if the stight line path the original point

2.
if you have gradient and point that strght line path it you can use this equation 
=y - y2> = m (x - x1)

example :

gradient = 3 , passing (1,4)
the equation equal 
=> (y - 4) = 3(x - 1) 
=> y = 3x + 1.

3.

if you have to point that strght line path it you can define the gradient by 
=> m = y1 - y1 / x2 - x1

then you will have a gradient and point so you could use the equation that you have in previous example

finally : 

ax + by + c = 0

a = 0 if the stright line is horizintaly
b = 0 if the stright line is vertically




circles 

a circle with center (h,k) and radius r > 0 the distance between all points (x , y) on the circle and (h , k) = r

standart equationm 
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2

example 
(h,k) = (-3 , 2) , r = 5

(x +2) ^ 2 + (Y - 3) ^ 2 = 25.


remember that : 
1- the distance between to point is

2- the midpoint between two points

* to write equation of a circle in standard form :-
1- group the same variables together on one side of the equation and the constanst in other sides.
2- complete square on both variables 
3- divide the both cofficent of the square
